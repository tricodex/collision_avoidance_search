## Installation
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the project repository.
3. Install required dependencies, particularly `wxPython`, using pip: `pip install wxPython`.

## Usage
To run the simulation:
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run `main.py` with Python: `python main.py`.
3. The GUI will display the simulation, where you can observe the behavior of bots.

## Configuration
- `settings.py` includes parameters such as `SIZE` for simulation area, `COUNT` for number of bots, `OBSTACLE_COUNT`, and other behavioral settings.
- These settings can be modified to alter the simulation's complexity and behavior.

## Features
- Real-time simulation of autonomous bots in a graphical environment.
- Customizable settings for bot count, obstacle placement, and simulation area.
- Visual interaction and observation of complex autonomous behaviors.
